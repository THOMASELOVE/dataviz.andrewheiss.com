# Refining and enhancing plots in Illustrator

## Install a vector image editor

- [**Adobe Illustrator**](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html): This is the industry standard vector editor; it's expensive, but [it's free for BYU students](https://it.byu.edu/byu/sc_help.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,b12dddc74f1a7240aa42d49f0310c798).
- [**Inkscape**](https://inkscape.org/en/): This is an open source editor, so it's free (yay!) but can be clunky to work with (boo). It's sufficient for what we're going to be doing, though. 
    - *Important for Mac users*: you have to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) before installing Inkscape, which is fine because you also need it for embedding custom fonts in R anyway
    - Also, the developers haven't paid for a macOS developer certificate, so Inkscape might show an error saying it can't open the first time you try to open it. If that happens, go find it in your "Applications" folder, right click on Inkscape, and choose "Open". You only have to do this one time—after you've opened it like this once, it will open just fine in the future.

## Make an image and refine it

**Text for annotations**: 

- Winners from Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest
- It's that time of year again. Since 1916, the annual eating competition has grown substantially attracting competitors from around the world
- Frank Dellarosa eats 21 and a half HDBs over 12 minutes, breaking the previous record of 19 and a half
- Through 2001-2005, Takeru Kobayashi wins by no less than 12 HDBs. In 2006 he only wins by 1.75. After winning 6 years in a row and setting the world record 4 times, Kobayashi places second in 2007.
- For the first time since 1999, an American reclaims the title when Joey Chestnut consumes 66 HDBs, a new world record. Chestnut repeats in 2008.

# Bonus `ggplot` features

## Extensions

So far, we've used a few extra packages to enhance our `ggplot` plots, like `ggrepel`, `gridExtra`, and `ggThemeAssist`. There are dozens of other `ggplot`-related packages, but it's hard to find them or know what exists. The [`ggplot2` Extensions Gallery](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/) helpfully lists 35^[As of October 9, 2017] different packages.

## Animation

You can use the [`gganimate` package](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) to add a new aesthetic "frame" to your plots, meaning you can map a variable like "year" to a plot to show changes over time. 

Install the package in R with this command: (it's not on CRAN so you can't use the "Packages" panel):

```{r install-gganimate, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages(devtools)  # Install devtools it it's not already installed
devtools::install_github("dgrtwo/gganimate")
```

Before you use it, though, you have to install two command line tools on your computer to manipulate images and videos. You don't actually have to ever use these programs—they just have to be installed, and `gganimate` will use them. 

- *ImageMagick*: tool for creating and manipulationg animated GIFs and other images 
- *FFmpeg*: tool for creating and manipulating movie files

**Installation on Windows**

1. Download [ImageMagick for Windows](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows) and run the installer. 
2. Make sure you select these options:^[{-} ![ImageMagick installation options for Windows](/images/class/im-windows-options.png)]
    - Add application directory to your system path
    - Install FFmpeg (this will save you from having to install FFMpeg separately)
    - Install legacy utilities
3. Restart your computer (or at least log out and log back in)

**Installation on macOS**

Because both ImageMagick and FFmpeg are Linux-based programs, and because underneath its fancy bells and whistles, macOS is essentially a Unix system, there's no automatic installer for macOS. You have to install ImageMagick and FFmpeg with Terminal instead, but it's not hard!

1. Open Terminal
2. Go to [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/), copy the big long command under "Install Homebrew" (starts with `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL...`), paste it into Terminal, and press enter. This installs Homebrew, which is special software that lets you install Unix-y programs from the terminal.^[{-} You can install stuff like MySQL, Python, Apache, and even R if you want; there's a [full list of Homebrew formulae here](http://formulae.brew.sh/).]
3. Type these three lines in Terminal:

        brew install imagemagick
        brew install libvpx
        brew install ffmpeg --with-libvpx

4. Wait for a few minutes while your Terminal makes you feel like a hacker.^[{-} `r blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "rUGQHdYUIEo")`]
5. The end. You shouldn't have to restart or log out.

**Usage**

We won't cover this in very much depth in class—look at [the documentation at GitHub for full details](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate). Here's a quick example, though. Note the new `frame = year` aesthetic mapping:

```{r build-gapminder, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show="animate"}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(gganimate)

rosling_plot <- ggplot(gapminder, 
                       aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, 
                           color = continent, frame = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  guides(size = FALSE, color = guide_legend(title = NULL)) + 
  labs(x = "Wealth", y = "Health") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r save-plot-slow, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
gganimate(rosling_plot, filename = "../../static/images/class/rosling_plot.gif", 
          ani.width=600, ani.height=400)
```

```{r save-plot-fast, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
gganimate(rosling_plot, filename = "../../static/images/class/rosling_plot_fast.gif", 
          ani.width=600, ani.height=400, interval=0.2)
```

```{r display-rosling-plot, eval=FALSE}
gganimate(rosling_plot)
```

![Animated Gapminder plot](/images/class/rosling_plot.gif)

You can also save the animation to your computer:

```{r save-example, eval=FALSE}
gganimate(rosling_plot, filename = "name_of_file.gif", 
          ani.width = 600, ani.height = 400)
gganimate(rosling_plot, filename = "name_of_file.mp4", 
          ani.width = 600, ani.height = 400)
```

You can adjust the animation speed with the `interval` argument in `gganimate()`:

```{r rosling-example-fast, eval=FALSE}
gganimate(rosling_plot, interval = 0.2)
```

![Fast animated Gapminder plot](/images/class/rosling_plot_fast.gif)

To use this in an R Markdown document, you have to include `fig.show="animate"` in the chunk options, otherwise each individual frame will be shown. If you're using a custom interval, you have to specify it with `interval=X`. You can also specify the output format for the HTML chunk (e.g. `gif`, `webm`, `mp4`, etc.):

    {r name-of-chunk, fig.show="animate", interval=0.2, ffmpeg.format="gif", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

These animations tend to not be very smooth, though, with data points jumping to their new positions every five years (in the case of the Gapminder data). We can make everything go a lot smoother with the [`tweenr` package](https://github.com/thomasp85/tweenr), which interpolates data points to smooth everything out. You have to transform the data little first, but the end result is magical:^[This code is from [David Smith](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/05/tweenr.html).]

```{r rosling-example-tween, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('tweenr')  # Install if necessary; it's on CRAN
library(tweenr)

gapminder_edit <- gapminder %>%
  arrange(country, year) %>%
  select(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, time = year, id = country, continent, pop) %>%
  mutate(ease="linear")

gapminder_tween <- tween_elements(gapminder_edit,
                                  "time", "id", "ease", nframes = 300) %>%
  mutate(year = round(time), country = .group) %>%
  left_join(gapminder, by=c("country", "year", "continent")) %>%
  rename(pop = pop.x)

rosling_plot_tween <- ggplot(gapminder_tween, 
                             aes(x = x, y = y, size = pop, 
                                 color = continent, frame = .frame)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  guides(size = FALSE, color = guide_legend(title = NULL)) + 
  labs(x = "Wealth", y = "Health") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

gganimate(rosling_plot_tween, filename = "rosling_plot_tween.mp4", 
          ani.width=600, ani.height=400, title_frame = FALSE, interval = 0.05)
```

```{r rosling-example-tween-save, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
gganimate(rosling_plot_tween, filename = "../../static/images/class/rosling_plot_tween.mp4", 
          ani.width=600, ani.height=400, title_frame = FALSE, interval = 0.05)
