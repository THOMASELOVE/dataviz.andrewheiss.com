# Making a bar chart in Excel

[^open-data] We'll create this chart in Excel, based on [publicly available data from Salt Lake City](http://data.slcgov.com/Package?package=city-of-salt-lake-police-cases-for-2012).

[^open-data]: {-} Salt Lake City does a fairly good job of providing open data for public use. The [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/) and [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) have a database of municipal data and rate cities by how accessible and available their data is. Their [US City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/) is a fantastic resource.

Things to download:

# Bonus extended example: Creating a production-quality SLCPD chart in R

^[{-} ![Salt Lake City Police Department badge](/images/class/slcpd-badge.jpg)] Previously, we used R ggplot2 to create analysis-ready graphics. We can create production-ready graphics using the same tools. Here's an example of a typical workflow:

```{r load-libraries-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)  # Loads the basic tidyverse packages like dplyr, tidyr, readr, etc.
library(forcats)  # Makes working with factors easier
library(ggstance)  # Create horizontal bar charts
library(scales)  # Add nicer axis labels to plots

# Install fonts
# install.packages("extrafont")
# extrafont::font_import(paths = NULL, recursive = TRUE, prompt = TRUE, pattern = NULL)


# Load data
crimes <- read_csv("data/police-cases-2012.csv")
```

[^view-data] First, check that the data loaded. You can (and should) also click on the `crimes` object in the Environment panel in RStudio.

[^view-data]: {-} You can also type `View(crimes)` to look at the data in RStudio.

```{r}
glimpse(crimes)
```

In Excel, we used a PivotTable to summarize the data by adding how many crimes of each type happened throughout the year. We can do the same with R, using the `dplyr` package (which is loaded automatically when you run `library(tidyverse)`).^[{-} Note that `OFFENSE DESCRIPTION` is between backticks. Ordinarily, you don't need to do this when using variable names, but in this case, there's a space in the name and that breaks everything. The \`s are R's way of quoting variable names.] 

Also in Excel, we only graphed the observations where the count was greater than 1,000. We can filter the data the same way here with `filter()`. View the `crimes_types` object when you're done.

```{r}
crimes_types <- crimes %>%
  group_by(`OFFENSE DESCRIPTION`) %>%
  summarize(number = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = number / sum(number)) %>%
  filter(number > 1000)

crimes_types
```

This data is sorted alphabetically by default, since we grouped the data by `OFFENSE DESCRIPTION`, but sorting it by the count or percent is easy. Note the final line with `fct_inorder`—this creates a new column called `crime` that is a *factor*, or a categorical variable. If we plot the `OFFENSE DESCRIPTION` variable, R will order it alphabetically. Transforming it into an ordered factor will make R plot the categories in the correct order.

```{r}
crimes_types_sorted <- crimes_types %>%
  arrange(desc(number)) %>%
  mutate(crime = fct_inorder(`OFFENSE DESCRIPTION`, ordered = TRUE))

crimes_types_sorted

crimes_types_sorted$crime
```

With the data summarized and sorted, we can finally plot it. We'll go over each of the pieces of this in class, so don't worry if it looks intimidating—this is the final product. The basic gist of what's happening is that we take a `ggplot()` object, map data to aesthetics (in this case `x` and `y` mapped to the `percent` variable and the `crime` variable), and then add a sequence of layers that determine how that data is plotted.

```{r plot-crimes}
ggplot(crimes_types_sorted, aes(x = percent, y = fct_rev(crime))) + 
  geom_barh(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = "Most frequent crimes in Salt Lake City",
       subtitle = "January 1-December 31, 2012",
       caption = "Source: data.slcgov.com") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = percent) +
  theme_light(base_family = "Source Sans Pro") + 
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro Light"),
        plot.caption = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro Light"),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro Semibold", size = rel(1.5)),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())
```

Highlighting the traffic bar is a little tricky, since we can't select it with the mouse and change the color by hand. The easiest way to do it is to create a new variable to map onto the fill color of each bar. We then remove the legend and modify the colors with `guides()` and `scale_fill_manual()`:

```{r plot-crimes-highlight}
crimes_highlight <- crimes_types_sorted %>%
  mutate(highlight = ifelse(crime == "TRAFFIC", TRUE, FALSE))

ggplot(crimes_highlight, aes(x = percent, y = fct_rev(crime), fill = highlight)) + 
  geom_barh(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = "Most frequent crimes in Salt Lake City",
       subtitle = "January 1-December 31, 2012",
       caption = "Source: data.slcgov.com") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = percent) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey70", "darkorange")) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_light(base_family = "Source Sans Pro") + 
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro Light"),
        plot.caption = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro Light"),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro Semibold", size = rel(1.5)),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())
```

Finally, adding the label is a little tricky too, since we can't manually type into the plot. Here, we add yet another variable to the data frame, this time for the text that will show up in the label. We only want to label the bars where `highlight == TRUE`, so we use an `ifelse()` statement to do that. We also save the plot to a variable instead of just plotting directly (i.e. instead of running `ggplot()`, we assign it to `plot_crimes`)

```{r plot-crimes-highlight-label}
crimes_highlight_label <- crimes_highlight %>%
  mutate(text = ifelse(highlight, paste0(round(percent * 100), "%"), ""))

plot_crimes <- ggplot(crimes_highlight_label, aes(x = percent, y = fct_rev(crime), 
                                                  fill = highlight, label = text)) + 
  geom_barh(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(hjust = 1.3, family = "Source Sans Pro", color = "white") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = "Most frequent crimes in Salt Lake City",
       subtitle = "January 1-December 31, 2012",
       caption = "Source: data.slcgov.com") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = percent) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey70", "darkorange")) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_light(base_family = "Source Sans Pro") + 
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro Light"),
        plot.caption = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro Light"),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro Semibold", size = rel(1.5)),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

plot_crimes
```

*Finally*, we can save this plot as a file using the `ggsave()` function. The plot should save just fine as a PNG file. Saving as a PDF is slightly trickier, though, since PDFs have embedded fonts. R's default PDF writer can only embed a handful of PDF fonts, but R has a second PDF writer based on the [Cairo graphics library](https://www.cairographics.org/) that can embed fonts just fine.^[{-} idk why ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯<br><br>R is just weird sometimes. You definitely don't need to understand the details of how Cairo works—I don't. All that matters is that when you use the Cairo PDF library, fonts are embedded properly and everything works.] You just have to specify the plotting device in `ggsave()` with `device = cairo_pdf`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggsave(filename = "plot_crimes.png", plot = plot_crimes,
       width = 6, height = 3.5, units = "in")

ggsave(filename = "plot_crimes.pdf", plot = plot_crimes,
       width = 6, height = 3.5, units = "in", device = cairo_pdf)
```

Using the Cairo library for PNGs can also be helpful. R sometimes generates wonky PNGs in Windows, and Cairo PNGs work better in PowerPoint and Word. Saving Cairo-based PNGs with `ggsave()` has a slightly different syntax (use `type = "cairo"` instead of `device = cairo_pdf`):

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggsave(filename = "plot_crimes_cairo.png", plot = plot_crimes,
       width = 6, height = 3.5, units = "in", type = "cairo")
```
