# Creating maps with R

Download these shapefiles, unzip them, and put them in your data folder: ^[{-} ![Example data folder](/images/class/data-folder-shapefiles.png)]

- [County Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/data/boundaries/citycountystate/)
- [Schools & Libraries](https://gis.utah.gov/data/society/schools-libraries/)

We're going to make these two maps:

```{r create-maps, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Make sure you install the development version of ggplot with
# devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(stringr)
library(gridExtra)

counties <- st_read("data/Counties/Counties.shp", quiet = TRUE)
libraries <- st_read("data/Libraries/Libraries.shp", quiet = TRUE)

libraries_county <- libraries %>%
  group_by(COUNTY) %>%
  summarize(num_libraries = n()) %>%
  mutate(NAME = str_to_upper(COUNTY))

counties_with_data <- counties %>%
  st_join(libraries_county) %>%
  mutate(people_per_library = POP_CURRES / num_libraries)

# In theory, geom_sf() should be able to plot points, and it does, but the
# latest development version ignores arguments like size = 5, so we have to use
# geom_point() instead. To do that, we have to extract the latitude and
# longitude values as individual columns, hence this libraries_lat_lon here
libraries_lat_lon <- cbind(libraries, st_coordinates(libraries))

plot_libraries <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = counties_with_data, aes(fill = num_libraries), size = 0.25) +
  geom_point(data = libraries_lat_lon, aes(x = X, y = Y), size = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#fee0d2", high = "#de2d26", na.value = "white") +
  guides(size = FALSE, 
         fill = guide_colorbar(title = "Number of libraries", 
                               title.position = "top", barwidth = 10)) +
  coord_sf(crs = 26912) + 
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

plot_people <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = counties_with_data, aes(fill = people_per_library), size = 0.25) +
  geom_point(data = libraries_lat_lon, aes(x = X, y = Y), size = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#fee0d2", high = "#de2d26", na.value = "white") +
  guides(size = FALSE, 
         fill = guide_colorbar(title = "People per library", 
                               title.position = "top", barwidth = 10)) +
  coord_sf(crs = 26912) + 
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

grid.arrange(plot_libraries, plot_people, nrow = 1)
```


# You're on your own!

Find a story in this data on animal bites in Louisville. Summarize the data, make a plot in R, export it as a PDF, and enhance it in Illustrator or Inkscape.

^[{-} [See complete column descriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/animal-bites). The data is released under a public domain license and hosted originally at Kaggle.] [<i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i> Louisville animal bites](/data/Health_AnimalBites.csv) 

*Hint*: You did stuff with this data last week, so you can [refer to the code there](/class/06-class/#final-figure). HOWEVER, don't tell the same story this time. We already know about cat, dog, and other bites over time. Find a different story.
