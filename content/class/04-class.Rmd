# Miscellaneous R stuff

Download Comic Relief data and place it in a folder named `data` in your project: [<i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i> Comic Relief 2015–2016 grants](/data/ComicRelief_360Giving_International.xlsx)

## Searching for code on GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an excellent source of real-world code, and it's easy to search for examples of things other people have written.^[{-} Use the advanced search to limit the search language to R.]

## Installing packages from GitHub

Not all R packages are hosted on CRAN—many are repositories that live on GitHub. It's possible to install packages from GitHub, but you can't use RStudio's "Packages" panel. Most non-CRAN packages will include instructions of how to install (such as this package for [ridge plots](https://github.com/clauswilke/ggridges)), but the general syntax is this:

```{r devtools-example, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("username/repository_name")

# Or, in one line
devtools::install_github("username/repository_name")

# So, in real life, you can do this:
devtools::install_github("clauswilke/ggridges")
devtools::install_github("andrewheiss/reconPlots")
```

## Pipes (`%>%`)

Pipes let you concatenate nested functions in a human-readable form and can make it a lot easier to understand your code:

```{r pipes, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Create a bunch of numbers
x <- rnorm(1000)

# Nest some functions
round(mean(x), digits = 2)
sqrt(var(x))
round(sqrt(var(x)), digits = 2)

# Use pipes to make nested functions easier to read and write
x %>% 
  var() %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  round(digits = 2)
```

Pipes are even more helpful when manipulating data frames. For instance, typically it's best to load the raw data as a data frame, clean it with a chain of functions, and then save it as a separate data frame:

```{r load-cr, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)

cr_raw <- read_excel("data/ComicRelief_360Giving_International.xlsx")

cr <- cr_raw %>%
  rename(amount = `Amount Awarded`,
         duration = `Planned Dates:Duration (months)`,
         program = `Grant Programme:Title`,
         award_date = `Award Date`) %>%
  # year() comes from lubridate and it extracts the year from a date object
  mutate(award_year = year(award_date)) %>%
  # as.factor() converts values to categorical variables
  mutate(award_year = as.factor(award_year))
```

## Working with ggplot objects

You can save the output of a `ggplot` plot to an object (`p1` here):

```{r plot1}
# Get rid of the largest grants
cr_filtered <- cr %>%
  filter(amount < 3000000)

p1 <- ggplot(cr_filtered, aes(x = duration, y = amount)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = award_year)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("green", "brown")) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "#274981") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
p1
```

When you save `ggplot` plots as objects, you can do fun things with them, like add additional layers without repeating all the code from the base plot:

```{r plot2-3}
p2 <- p1 + 
  labs(title = "Some cool title")
p2

p3 <- p2 +
  theme_bw()
p3
```

… or saving the plot to your computer:

```{r ggsave-example, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(p1, filename = "plot1.pdf")
ggsave(p2, filename = "plot2.png", width = 5, height = 7, units = "in")
ggsave(p3, filename = "plot3.pdf", width = 5, height = 7, units = "in")
# etc.
```

… or arranging multiple plots:

```{r grid-arrange-example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 1)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 3)
```

If you want to save one of these combined plots to an object, you need to use `arrangeGrob()` instead of `grid.arrange()`:

```{r arrangegrob-example}
p_lots_of_them <- arrangeGrob(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 3)
```

```{r ggsave-arrangegrob, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(p_lots_of_them, filename = "lots_o_plots.pdf")
```

If you want to plot a saved `arrangeGrob` object, you have to use these two functions:

```{r grid-draw-grob}
grid::grid.newpage()  # Clear out whatever plot is there already
grid::grid.draw(p_lots_of_them)  # Draw the combined plot
```

## Fonts

It's relatively easy to use custom fonts in `ggplot` plots, but there are some tricks. [Read this post for more details and for instructions for how to do it on macOS and Windows](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2017/09/27/working-with-r-cairo-graphics-custom-fonts-and-ggplot/).

## Colors

You can specify colors in R in a few different ways:

- R has hundreds of built-in named colors, [listed here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)^[{-} I typically don't use these, except for the `greyXX` colors, since it's easier to use something like `c("grey30", "grey60", "grey90")` to get a series of greyscale colors than looking up their hex codes.]
- You can use hex codes (`#203864`, `#DC5B44`, etc.) or RGB values (`rgb(0, 146, 255)`)
- You can use special scales that draw on fancy algorithms and hand-picked color palettes, like [Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) and [Viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html)

```{r color-example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(viridis)
ggplot(cr_filtered, aes(x = duration, y = amount)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = as.factor(program))) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)

ggplot(cr_filtered, aes(x = duration, y = amount)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = as.factor(program))) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual")

ggplot(cr_filtered, aes(x = duration, y = amount)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = as.factor(award_year))) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#203864", "#DC5B44"))
```


## Theme options

You can make adjustments to plots with the `theme()` function, but there are a billion different options to play with. To simplify life, you can install a GUI interface for manipulating themes [with the `ggThemeAssist` package](https://github.com/calligross/ggthemeassist). Once it's installed, you can access it in RStudio with the "Addins" menu at the top of the window. You must have a ggplot object selected for it to work.

`ggThemeAssist` will generate a bunch of settings inside a `theme()` function. If you want to reuse those settings in other plots, you can assign them to a variable and then add that variable as a layer to other plots:

```{r ugly-theme}
# This was all generated with ggThemeAssist
my_ugly_theme <- theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45), 
                       panel.background = element_rect(fill = "darkgoldenrod1"), 
                       plot.background = element_rect(fill = "antiquewhite"), 
                       legend.background = element_rect(fill = "hotpink"), 
                       legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "horizontal")

p1 + labs(x = "Months", y = "Amount", title = "Cool stuff") +
  my_ugly_theme
```
