# Comparing things

## Sparklines

- [Create in Excel](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-sparklines-to-show-data-trends-1474e169-008c-4783-926b-5c60e620f5ca) 
- Create in Word, HTML, and Adobe products with [AtF Spark](http://aftertheflood.co/projects/atf-spark)
- Create in R by saving really really tiny PDFs or PNGs

## Small multiples

- Create in R with facets

## Lollipops

[<i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i> Download Lord of the Rings data](/data/Lord_Of_The_Rings.csv)

First, we load the libraries we'll need for all the examples. We'll use `tidyverse` in both; we'll use `forcats` in the lollipop chart and `ggrepel` in the slopegraph.

```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(ggrepel)
```

We load the CSV file into R and save it as a variable, or an object, named `lotr`. We use `fct_inorder()` inside a mutate command to make the `Film` variable an ordered factor so that the films plot in the correct order.

```{r lollipops, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lotr <- read_csv("data/Lord_Of_The_Rings.csv") %>%
  mutate(Film = fct_inorder(Film, ordered = TRUE))
```

Next we summarize the data by race and gender. We can output the summarized table as a Markdown table with `knitr::kable()`. Remember that this syntax means that we're using the `kable()` function inside the `knitr` package without actually loading it. Alternatively, you can run `library(knitr)` to load the package and then use `kable()` as needed without the double colon `::`.

```{r sunmmarize-race-gender}
race_gender <- lotr %>% 
  group_by(Race, Gender) %>%
  summarize(total_words = sum(Words))

knitr::kable(race_gender)
```

We can plot this summarized data, mapping variables to different aesthetics in the plot. A few things to note:

- `geom_pointrange()` is what makes the lollipops. It takes two aesthetics: `ymin` and `ymax`. Here we want `ymin` to be zero so that all the lines start at the axis, but in other situations you could set it to an actual variable. 
- `position_dodge()` and `width` is what tells the point ranges to be plotted side-by-side.
- `coord_flip()` rotates the whole plot so that the x-axis becomes the y-axis and vice versa.^[{-} Alternatively, you can avoid using `coord_flip()` by using `geom_pointrangeh()` (and all the other `*h` functions like `geom_barh` and `geom_colh()` in the `ggstance` library.]

```{r plot-race-gender, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
ggplot(race_gender, aes(x = Gender, y = total_words, color = Race)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = total_words), 
                  position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "orange", "blue"))
```

We can also plot race and gender across the three films. Because we used `fct_inorder()` earlier, the `Film` variable/column is an ordered factor and the films should be in order. Here we use the original `lotr` data frame instead of the summarized one, since we want the `Film` column too. We facet by film with `facet_wrap(~ Film)`.

```{r plot-race-gender-film, fig.width=8, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(lotr, aes(x = Gender, y = Words, color = Race)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = Words), 
                  position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "orange", "blue")) +
  facet_wrap(~ Film)
```

## Slopegraphs

[<i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i> Download General Conference "isms" data](/data/isms_top5.csv)^[{-} This data comes from [BYU's LDS General Conference Corpus](https://www.lds-general-conference.org/). I created a list of `"*ism"` divided between the 1950s/60s and the 1990s/2000s, and then copied/pasted the results in to a CSV file.]

First, we load the data. I already filtered and summarized and tidyified this data, based on the original data that [looked liked this](/data/isms_full.csv). You can [see the R code I used to clean and tidy the data here](/code/clean_isms.R).

```{r load-slope-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
isms <- read_csv("data/isms_top5.csv")

knitr::kable(isms)
```

Just plotting the data as-is gives us a rudimentary and ugly slopegraph. Note the `group` aesthetic—without it, the lines will not plot across the `coldwar` and `today` columns.

```{r slope-ugly, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(isms, aes(x = decade, y = permil, group = word)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.5) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = word))
```

We can add a bunch of columns to the original `isms` data frame to help with plotting. Here's what's happening:

- We create a `label_first` variable for the labels on the right side of the plot. We use `ifelse()`—if the decade is `coldwar`, use `paste0()` to combine the `word` column with the `permil` (or per million words) value, surrounded by parentheses; if it's not `coldwar`, use a missing value, or `NA`
- We create a `label_last` variable similarly, but this time only include the `permil` value on rows that aren't `coldwar`
- We create a `highlight` column to mark which lines we want colored
- We recode the `decade` column to nicer values

```{r create-isms-plot-df}
isms_plot <- isms %>%
  mutate(label_first = 
           ifelse(decade == "coldwar", paste0(word, " (", permil, ")"), NA)) %>%
  mutate(label_last = ifelse(decade == "today", permil, NA)) %>%
  mutate(highlight = ifelse(word %in% c("Socialism", "Communism"), TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(decade = recode(decade,
                         coldwar = "1950-1969",
                         today = "1990-2009"))
```

We can use this enhanced data frame to add labels and color specific lines. Here's the complete, final plot. A few things to note:

- `geom_text_repel()` comes from the `ggrepel` library and uses fancy algorithms to ensure labels don't overlap. We set `direction = "y"` to make sure the algorithm only shifts labels up and down (without it, the labels will show up everywhere), and we use `nudge_x` to move the labels horizontally away from the lines. We can use `seed = some_number` to ensure the random positioning of the labels is the same each time the plot is generated.
- We use a super minimal `theme_minimal()` theme and them make a few more adjustments with `theme()` to remove grid lines and the y axis text.
- R will give two warnings saying `Removed 5 rows containing missing values (geom_text_repel).` This is because it's trying to plot missing values for the labels—but recall that we *created* those missing values in both `label_first` and `label_last`, so it's not an issue. We're purposely causing the warning and we can ignore it.

```{r final-slope-plot, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
fancy_plot <- ggplot(isms_plot, aes(x = decade, y = permil, group = word, color = highlight)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_first), direction = "y", nudge_x = -1, seed = 1234) + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_last), direction = "y", nudge_x = 1, seed = 1234) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red")) + 
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Frequency of words ending in ‘ism’ in\nLDS General Conference talks",
       subtitle = "Word (occurrences per million words)",
       x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())
fancy_plot
```

Because we saved the plot to a variable (`fancy_plot`), we can do stuff with it like saving it to our computer with `ggsave()`:

```{r save-plots, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(fancy_plot, filename = "output/words.pdf", 
       width = 7, height = 4, units = "in")
ggsave(fancy_plot, filename = "output/words.png", 
       width = 7, height = 4, units = "in")
```

Finally, just for fun, we can use nicer fonts to make the graphic even nicer. We'll use Roboto Condensed, which is [free from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed).

- If you're using macOS, ensure that you [install XQuartz first](https://www.xquartz.org/). That's all you have to do to get the Cairo graphics library working.
- If you're using Windows, either reload all the system fonts (after installing Roboto Condensed) with `extrafont::font_import()` or load the Roboto Condensed fonts individually on-the-fly:

```{r load-windows-fonts, eval=FALSE}
windowsFonts(`Roboto Condensed` = windowsFont("Roboto Condensed"))
windowsFonts(`Roboto Condensed Light` = windowsFont("Roboto Condensed Light"))
```

With that, we can specify font families and font faces (bold, italic, plain, etc.) in `geom_text_repel()` and in `theme()`:

```{r final-slope-plot-fonts, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
nice_fonts <- ggplot(isms_plot, aes(x = decade, y = permil, group = word, color = highlight)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_first), direction = "y", nudge_x = -1,
                  family = "Roboto Condensed Light", fontface = "plain",
                  seed = 1234) + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = label_last), direction = "y", nudge_x = 0.3,
                  family = "Roboto Condensed Light", fontface = "plain",
                  seed = 1234) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red")) + 
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Frequency of words ending in ‘ism’ in\nLDS General Conference talks",
       subtitle = "Word (occurrences per million words)",
       x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Roboto Condensed") + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed Light",
                                     color = "grey50", face = "plain"))
nice_fonts
```

We can save the plot with the custom fonts with `ggsave()` like always, but we have to use the Cairo graphics library to get the fonts to embed and to get a PNG with proper dimensions. Note the difference between the two—PDFs need `device = cairo_pdf` while PNGs need `type = "cairo"`. It's different and I don't fully understand why but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

```{r save-nice-fonts, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(plot_isms, filename = "isms.pdf", device = cairo_pdf,
       width = 6, height = 4, units = "in")
ggsave(plot_isms, filename = "isms.png", type = "cairo",
       width = 6, height = 4, units = "in")
```


## Bullet charts

[<i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i> Download fake performance data](/data/performance.csv)

Bullet charts are just a bunch of bar charts stacked on top of each with with extra dots and lines. First we load a data frame I copied from Stephanie Evergreen's book, and we make sure the region variable—here named `measure`—is an ordered factor, and we reverse it with `fct_rev()` because `coord_flip()` does weird stuff to the ordering.

```{r load-performance-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
performance <- read_csv("data/performance.csv")

knitr::kable(performance)
```

With the data in this form, it's easy to plot. Here are a couple things to note:

- We overlay a bunch of `geom_col()` layers with different aesthics set for each
- `geom_errorbar()` creates a line at the target level. We add a `geom_point()` layer in the same place for fun

```{r bullet-plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(performance) +
  geom_col(aes(x = measure, y = good), fill="goldenrod2", width = 0.5, alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_col(aes(measure, satisfactory), fill="goldenrod3", width = 0.5, alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_col(aes(measure, bad), fill="goldenrod4", width = 0.5, alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_col(aes(measure, value), fill="black", width = 0.2) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x= measure, ymin = target, ymax = target), color = "red", width = 0.45) +
  geom_point(aes(measure, target), colour = "red", size = 2.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 50, 100)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Roboto Condensed") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```
