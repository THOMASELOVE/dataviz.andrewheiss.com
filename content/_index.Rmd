Data rarely speaks for itself. Without clear communication and a convincing argument, the theoretically rigorous and groundbreaking results you have found after months of backbreaking toil can easily be ignored.

In this class youâ€™ll learn how to use techniques long used by storytellers, documentarians, and artists to communicate your scientific findings in a way that is effective, engaging, professional, enjoyable, and memorable.
