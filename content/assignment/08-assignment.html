<p>Complete these tasks in an R Markdown file and <a href="mailto:andrew_heiss@byu.edu">e-mail me</a> a PDF of the final compiled document. <a href="/files/your_name_homework8.Rmd">Here’s the typical starter file</a>. As always, I recommend saving it within an RStudio project. Make sure the final output is as clean and warning/message free as possible.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-reflection-memo">Task 1: Reflection memo</h2>
<p><em>This memo is different</em>. Write <strong>≈100</strong> words about the <a href="/reading/08-reading/">the assigned readings</a> for this week. You can use some of the prompt questions there if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is qualitative data difficult to visualize?</li>
<li>Why are word clouds so problematic? When is (not) okay to use them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, write <strong>≈400</strong> words exploring a few of these summative questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is truth?</li>
<li>How do we find truth?</li>
<li>Are facts truth?</li>
<li>What’s the difference between content and form?</li>
<li>Does beauty matter when describing truth?</li>
<li>How does any of this philosophical humanities stuff relate to data visualization?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-2-text-visualization">Task 2: Text visualization</h2>
<p>Work through <a href="https://uc-r.github.io/tidy_text">this tutorial on visualizing text in <em>Harry Potter</em> with the <code>tidytext</code> package</a> (which you’ll need to install with the RStudio “Packages” panel). You don’t need to understand all the code (it even uses some <code>for</code> loops!),<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> Really, all you’re doing here is copying/pasting stuff into an Rmd file, so it shouldn’t take too long. Try to understand what’s happening with the code though.<br />
<br />
</span></span> but it’ll give you the gist of working with words. We’ll cover this in more detail in class on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Include the graph of the 10 most common words in the 7 Harry Potter books and the scatterplot of frequencies from the tutorial in your knitted document.</p>
