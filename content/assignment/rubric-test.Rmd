Before you turn in your final rubric, you'll need to make sure it actually works. Use your improved and commented-upon draft rubric to evaluate the two visualizations below. 

You'll only be graded for completion, but you'll want to do a thorough job to make sure your rubric works and matches expectations. You might also want to have a friend grade the same visualizations with your rubric to see if the scores are consistent across graders (especially since I'll be using your rubric on your final project).

[Email me](mailto:andrew_heiss@byu.edu) a PDF of your filled-in rubric for each visualization, along with a short paragraph describing how well it worked/didn't work and what changes you made/didn't make.


# Visualization 1

[*The Washington Post,* "Who's in and who's out of the Paris agreement, by total greenhouse gas emissions"][wapo-paris]

You need to view the full graphic at the Washington Post's website—don't grade the visualization based on the screenshot below.
