<p>Before you turn in your final rubric, you’ll need to make sure it actually works. Use your improved and commented-upon draft rubric to evaluate the two visualizations below.</p>
<p>You’ll only be graded for completion, but you’ll want to do a thorough job to make sure your rubric works and matches expectations. You might also want to have a friend grade the same visualizations with your rubric to see if the scores are consistent across graders (especially since I’ll be using your rubric on your final project).</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew_heiss@byu.edu">Email me</a> a PDF of your filled-in rubric for each visualization, along with a short paragraph describing how well it worked/didn’t work and what changes you made/didn’t make.</p>

<p>You need to view the full graphic at the Washington Post’s website—don’t grade the visualization based on the screenshot below.</p>
