<p>As always, complete these tasks in an R Markdown file and <a href="mailto:andrew_heiss@byu.edu">e-mail me</a> a Word file or a PDF of the final compiled document. <a href="/files/your_name_homework5.Rmd">Here’s a starter file</a>.<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Your browser will most likely open it as a new tab instead of downloading the file. Either right click on the link and choose “Save link as…” or copy and paste the text into a blank R Markdown file in RStudio.<br />
<br />
</span></span> I recommend saving it within an RStudio project.</p>

</span></span> memo about <a href="/reading/05-reading/">the assigned readings</a> for this week. You can use some of the prompt questions there if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>In chapter 3, Evergreen provides a ton of new ways to present comparisons. Which ones are your favorite? Which ones didn’t quite click with you? In what situations are some more appropriate than others?</li>
<li>Do combo charts and bullet graphs break the rule against double y-axes? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you write the memo, also consider these central questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do these readings connect to our main goal of discovering truth?</li>
<li>How does what I just read apply to me?</li>
<li>How can this be useful to me?</li>
</ul>

</span></span> Back to Excel for a minute! <a href="/data/NYC_Rats_2010_2016.xlsx"><i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i> Download this data on the number of rat sightings in New York City’s five boroughs in 2010 and 2016</a> and create a slopegraph following Stephanie Evergreen’s tutorial on pages 36–44 in <em>Effective Data Visualization</em>. Include the finished graphic in the memo.</p>
<p>Important tip: You can include images in Markdown with the follwing syntax: <code>![Caption for the image](path/to/the/image.png)</code>. If you’re exporting the memo as a PDF, include a PDF version of the slopegraph; f you’re exporting the memo as HTML or docx, include a PNG version of the slopegraph.</p>
<p>(So, if you put the image in a folder named <code>images/</code> in your project directory, you’d do something like this): <code>![My fancy slopegraph](images/finished_slopegraph.png)</code></p>

<p>You’ll answer a bunch of questions about this data, and you’ll find those questions <a href="/files/your_name_homework5.Rmd">in this week’s homework template</a>.</p>
<p><code>ggplot</code> works best when your data is <em>tidy</em>. This doesn’t just mean that the data is clean and free of errors—it refers to data that meets three specific criteria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each variable must have its own column.</li>
<li>Each observation must have its own row.</li>
<li>Each value must have its own cell.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data you come across in the real world is often not tidy—not because it’s wrong, but because it’s structured in a way that makes it easier for humans to read. For instance, look at this table of words spoken in Peter Jackson’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy:<span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Data from <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/">Jenny Bryan’s lesson on tidy data</a>.<br />
<br />

<p>Tidy data makes these kinds of calculations far easier. Here’s that same data in tidy format:</p>

</figure>
<p>This is longer and more repetitive (and perhaps ugly), but far, far easier for computers to work with. Each varaible has its own column now (<code>Film</code>, <code>Gender</code>, <code>Race</code>, and <code>Words</code>), each observation has its own row, and each value is in its own cell.</p>
<p>Untidy data comes in lots of different forms, but the R package <code>tidyr</code> (which is part of the <code>tidyverse</code> and is loaded when you run <code>library(tidyverse)</code>), can tidyify pretty much anything. You can see full details in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html">this vignette for <code>tidyr</code></a>.</p>
